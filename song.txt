There's div and nor and mult and or and s-l-l-v sra
There's zor and swill and beck and sill and beh-geezal jumps today
And mult-you, srav (one syllable), and jay combined with l-h-u and l-u-i
And also slit and b-n-e and instruction m-t-high
There's shih and sib and l-b-u and blez and jal and then slit-u
And of course there's and and add and srill and sub and things to do
With the MIPS instructions I am very nimble on my feet
And though I sing assembler but I am really not a geek

There's add-u, or-i, slitty, swir, and beh-gez and jal-er too
And loads of other fun instructions that were put in just for you
The MIPS instruction set is very simple to be memor-ized
Which will come in handy when you have your code to optimize!
There's addy, div-u, lh, reef, and sis-call, jr, miff-c-z
And m-f-c-one, nop, and break, and blitz-al with b-c-z-t
And s-r-l-v, zor-i, blitz, and lb, lwill, and addyu
andy, sub-u, lwer, and lwiscz, m-t-c-z, slittyu
There's bczf, b-g-t-z to branch if it's greater than
And em-flow and sw, these instructions are not any also-rans
There's m-t-low and swizzy too, although I don't know what they're for
And lwee - that's obviously load word from mem bytes there are four

And now my song is through and I know all of my words by the heart
Which will come in handy when we have our projects multi-part
I live and breathe the MIPS instruction set on every night and day
Because the MIPS assembler will always try and work my way!
